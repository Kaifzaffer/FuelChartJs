# Fuel Level Monitoring Dashboard

This project is a React-based web application that visualizes fuel level data over time using Recharts, a charting library. The application fetches fuel level data from a local `response.json` file, displaying a line chart where the Y-axis represents fuel levels and the X-axis represents timestamps. The chart also features customizable tooltips, axis labels, and grid lines for clarity.

## Features

- **Fuel Level Line Chart**: Displays fuel level changes over time in a clear and responsive manner.
- **Custom Axis Labels**: Y-axis labeled as `Fuel Level`, X-axis labeled as `Timestamp`.
- **Responsive Design**: Chart adjusts dynamically to various screen sizes.
- **Data from JSON File**: Fetches data from a local `response.json` file located in the `public` folder.
- **Recharts Integration**: Utilizes the Recharts library for smooth and interactive data visualization.
